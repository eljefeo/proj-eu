	 * The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. 
Note that 1 = 0^2 + 1^2 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Find the sum of all the numbers less than 10^8 that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.
